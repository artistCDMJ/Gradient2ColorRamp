# Gradient2ColorRamp
Update number 1!

Gradient Manager panel is in the Paint tab.

Name your *Material* first to coincide with the kind of gradient you are making.

*Create Horcrux* will create a new container object to store the materials that contain our color ramps to manage gradients.

*Add Material* this will add a new material to set a new category - type the new name up top first, then press Add Material to create the category.

*Select* Here you can choose from the materials on the Horcrux object to see the gradients on.

*Add Color Ramp* this will add a new color ramp to the active category/material.

*Remove Color Ramp* this will remove only the color ramp that has been indicated with the unlock icon. 


For now, this is mostly done but I need to think more of there is anything else that needs attention, like how many horcrux objects might exist and if there might ever be a conflict that needs resolution.

Go have fun.
